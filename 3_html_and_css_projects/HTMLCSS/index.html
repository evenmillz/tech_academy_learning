              Grace Hopper was a trailblazing computer scientist and U.S. Navy
              rear admiral whose groundbreaking work revolutionized modern
              computing. Known as the “Queen of Code,” she developed the first
              compiler, making programming languages accessible and paving the
              way for COBOL. Hopper’s innovative spirit, commitment to progress,
              and advocacy for women in technology cemented her legacy as one of
              the most influential figures in tech history. Explore her
              remarkable journey of resilience, creativity, and leadership.

        <p>
          Grace Hopper, born Grace Brewster Murray on December 9, 1906, in New
          York City, demonstrated an early passion for learning and an
          insatiable curiosity about how things worked. As a child, she once
          dismantled seven alarm clocks to understand their mechanisms, a trait
          that hinted at her future in problem-solving and innovation. Hopper
          excelled academically, earning a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and
          physics from Vassar College in 1928. Her ambition led her to Yale
          University, where she earned a master’s degree in 1930 and a Ph.D. in
          mathematics in 1934—an extraordinary achievement for a woman in a
          male-dominated field at the time. She later returned to Vassar as a
          professor, shaping young minds and laying the groundwork for her
          pioneering career. Hopper’s formative years were marked by a
          relentless drive to challenge norms, a trait that would define her
          legacy in computing, military service, and cultural impact.

      <!--Career-->
      <div class="info_tile">
        <a id="career"><h3>Career</h3></a>
        <p>
          Grace Hopper’s career was a journey of groundbreaking achievements
          that bridged the worlds of computer science, military innovation, and
          cultural transformation. During World War II, Hopper joined the U.S.
          Navy Reserve, where she was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance
          Computation Project at Harvard University. There, she worked on the
          Mark I, one of the first programmable computers, documenting its
          operations and pioneering early programming concepts. After the war,
          Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, contributing to
          the development of UNIVAC I, the first commercial electronic computer.
          Her most notable contribution during this time was the invention of
          the first compiler, a tool that translated human-readable instructions
          into machine code. This revolutionary innovation laid the foundation
          for modern programming and paved the way for the development of COBOL
          (Common Business-Oriented Language), a language that brought computing
          to the business world and is still in use today. Hopper’s role in
          advancing machine-independent programming languages transformed the
          tech industry. Her influence extended beyond technology, as she
          tirelessly advocated for diversity and inclusivity in computing,
          inspiring countless women and underrepresented groups to pursue
          careers in STEM fields.

        <p>
          Retirement was merely a new chapter for Grace Hopper, as she remained
          an active and influential figure well into her later years. Although
          she retired from the Navy Reserve in 1966, she was recalled to active
          duty in 1967 to help standardize the Navy’s computing systems. Hopper
          continued serving until her final retirement in 1986, becoming one of
          the oldest active-duty commissioned officers in U.S. Navy history at
          the rank of Rear Admiral (lower half). Post-retirement, Hopper worked
          as a senior consultant for Digital Equipment Corporation, where she
          traveled extensively, lecturing and advocating for advancements in
          computing. Her lively presentations and witty anecdotes captivated
          audiences, earning her the affectionate nickname “Grandma COBOL.” She
          used her platform to encourage young people to innovate boldly,
          famously quipping, “It’s easier to ask forgiveness than permission.”
          Grace Hopper’s retirement years were a testament to her enduring
          commitment to progress and mentorship. Her contributions were
          recognized with numerous awards, including the National Medal of
          Technology and Innovation. Today, her legacy lives on, not only in the
          systems and programming languages she helped create but also in the
          inspiration she provided to generations of innovators and pioneers.

          In August 1982, then-Captain Grace Hopper delivered a lecture titled
          “Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People” to
          National Security Agency (NSA) employees. In this presentation, she
          discussed the evolution of computing technology and its implications
          for the future. Hopper emphasized the transition from large,
          centralized computers to more distributed systems, highlighting the
          potential of microcomputers and the importance of understanding
          information flow within organizations. She drew parallels between the
          early days of the automobile industry and the burgeoning field of
          computing, cautioning against focusing solely on individual components
          without considering the broader system. She also addressed the
          significance of data security, the value of information, and the
          necessity for adaptable software and hardware solutions. Her insights
          underscored the need for a holistic approach to information management
          and the importance of innovation in addressing emerging challenges in
          the digital age. This lecture, recently declassified and made
          available by the NSA, offers valuable perspectives on the foundational
          principles of technology and leadership. It reflects Hopper’s
          forward-thinking mindset and her contributions to computer science and
          the military. Long thought lost to time because it was recorded on
          media no longer supported by modern playback equipment, the lecture
          was recently recovered and released to the world. You can watch it in
          two parts below.
